An Arduino based controller for electric vehicles.

## :star: Features

- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Simple potentiometer speed control

## :car: Purpose

I created this controller for my electric Go-Kart hobby project. The idea is to later extend this with a serial connected Raspberry Pi which is going to be used as a display to show information like the speed or the temperature.
